title: Mobile Device Detection and Geotools for CodeIgniter

<h1>Mobile Device Detection and Geotools for CodeIgniter</h1> 
<p>Recently I discovered <a href="http://getsparks.org">GetSparks.org</a> a Ruby Gem like package manager for the PHP framework, <a href="http://codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter</a>.  CodeIgniter is a great, lightweight framework and the sparks system makes setting up a new application even easier, providing lots of useful functionality, ready to work straight out of the box.</p> 
<p>I&#8217;ve released a couple of sparks over the last few days.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><a href="http://getsparks.org/packages/mobiledetection/versions/HEAD/show">mobiledetection</a> &#8211; a port of the <a href="http://jamesconstable.co.uk/web-development/mobile-device-detection-in-coldfusion/">Coldfusion mobile device detection</a> library I had previously released.</li> 
<li><a href="http://getsparks.org/packages/geotools/versions/HEAD/show">geotools</a> &#8211; a (albeit small at the minute) collection of tools for performing geography related calculations and geocoding</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If you&#8217;re not interested in using sparks (and I think you should, its well worth a look if you&#8217;re building CodeIgniter based applications) then you grab the code from <a href="https://github.com/weejames">my GitHub account</a> where I&#8217;ve included manual installation and usage instructions.</p>
