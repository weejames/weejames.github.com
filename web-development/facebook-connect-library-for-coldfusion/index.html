<h1>Facebook Connect Library for ColdFusion</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve dropped an initial release of the <a href="http://github.com/weejames/Facebook-Connect-Library-for-Cold-Fusion">Facebook Connect library for ColdFusion</a> I built onto my <a href="http://github.com/weejames" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/github.com');">GitHub account</a>.  It works perfectly under the limited testing i&#8217;ve actually done.  I&#8217;ve only tested under Railo 3 but dont think there&#8217;s any real reason why it won&#8217;t work fine in the Adobe CF server.  There&#8217;s no documentation yet but i&#8217;ll get to that eventually as well.</p> 
<p><strong>Update: </strong>The library should now work on CF9 (and probably CF8 but I dont have that to test on)</p>
