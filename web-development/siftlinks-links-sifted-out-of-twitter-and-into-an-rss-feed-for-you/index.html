<h1>SiftLinks: Links sifted out of Twitter and into an RSS feed for you.</h1> 
<p>There&#8217;s a couple of things I&#8217;ve been wanting to play with recently &#8211; the Twitter Auth protocol (and subsequently the <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/">Twitter API</a>) and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a>. There&#8217;s also been something bugging me about Twitter recently.  I follow a few interesting folk who post a lot of interesting links.  But sometimes I disappear for a few days for work or for fun and despite seeing these links on my iPhone, I don&#8217;t really get the chance to properly read the articles.</p> 
<p>What i needed was a way to strip out Tweets with a link in them and pick those links up in my feed reader when I get the chance to catch up with whats going on in the world.</p> 
<p>And so I combined the aforementioned desire to experiment with new stuff and the need for an rss of my tweets with links in them to build <a href="http://siftlinks.com">SiftLinks</a>.  It&#8217;s still in the testing phase and I&#8217;m making various optimisations as I go along &#8211; but it works.  If you have a need to <a href="http://siftlinks.com">extract links from twitter</a> then give it a go and let me know how you get on.</p>
