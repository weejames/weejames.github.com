<h1>WordPress on Amazon EC2</h1> 
<p>With a wee bit of time to spare over the Christmas period <a href="http://ocean70.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/ocean70.com');">we</a> took the opportunity to move our hosting infrastructure from an aging <a href="http://www.fasthosts.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/www.fasthosts.com');">Fasthosts</a> dedicated server to an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/aws.amazon.com');">Amazon EC2</a> instance.  All of our client sites are now up and running, as is my blog, which has also been freshly updated to <a href="http://wordpress.org/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/wordpress.org');">WordPress 2.7</a>.  Anyone who&#8217;s been here before may have noticed how much faster the site is on EC2 and the same can be said for all of the <a href="http://beaumontpps.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/beaumontpps.com');">other</a> <a href="http://www.capito.co.uk" >sites</a> <a href="http://lpmonline.co.uk" >running</a> on it.</p> 
<p>I&#8217;ll write more soon about our setup.</p>
